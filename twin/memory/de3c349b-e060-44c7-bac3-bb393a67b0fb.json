    "content": "Hello there! I'm Ayush.\n\nMy development journey spans about 5 years, primarily focused on software engineering and AI. I started building a strong foundation in full-stack development, working on various projects that honed my skills across different parts of the tech stack.\n\nOver time, my interest naturally gravitated more towards AI. I've been involved in AI research, which has been incredibly fascinating. Currently, I'm a Research Intern at NECLABS Europe, where I'm deeply immersed in AI engineering, which is also my current learning focus. It's an exciting field that brings together my background in software development with the cutting edge of AI.",

You're right, I can definitely share more about my past roles.\n\nBefore my current research internship at NECLABS Europe, I've had a diverse set of experiences:\n\n*   **GenAI/Full Stack Developer (Werkstudent) at BASF** in Ludwigshafen, Germany, from November 2024 to May 2025. There, I worked on a Python solution for time series analysis and prototyped an LLM-based contract summarizer.\n*   **Full Stack Developer at Inline Process Solutions** (a startup) in Germany, from February 2023 to October 2024. I was the lead Front-end developer for their core client-facing application.\n*   **Frontend Lead (Werkstudent) at Co2Opt** (another startup) in Hamburg, Germany, from June 2022 to July 2023, where I led the front-end development of a core SaaS application.\n*   Prior to that, I worked as a **Full Stack Developer at GreatLearning & Altimetrik** (startups/mid-size companies) in Bengaluru, India, from January 2020 to April 2022. In that role, I delivered an analytics platform using ReactJs, Django, and PostgreSQL.\n\nIt's been a journey through various industries and company sizes, always with a strong focus on delivering robust solutions.",

    "content": "Given my experience, I'd say my solid skills fall into a few core areas:\n\n1.  **Full-stack Development:** I have a strong foundation here, particularly with **React.js** for front-end development, and **Python-based backends** using frameworks like **Django** and **Flask/FastAPI**. I'm also very comfortable working with robust databases like **PostgreSQL**.\n2.  **AI & Generative AI:** This is a major focus for me right now. I have practical experience with **LLMs (Large Language Models)**, including fine-tuning and transfer learning, utilizing models like **ESM-LLMs** for research. I'm adept with **PyTorch**, **HuggingFace**, and concepts like **Transformers**, **RAG**, and **Diffusion Models**.\n3.  **Front-end Leadership & UI/UX:** I've led front-end teams and architected client-facing applications, focusing on creating intuitive, responsive **Single Page Applications (SPAs)** using **React** and **TypeScript**.\n4.  **AI Research & Engineering:** From developing in silico pipelines integrating LLMs with AlphaFold to building phylogenetic distance models and working with multi-agent systems, I'm actively engaged in applying AI to solve complex problems.\n\nThese are the areas where I feel I have the most significant and hands-on experience, and where I'm constantly looking to deepen my expertise.",
